/-- A single *move*: pick two entries `m, n` (from two distinct positions,
modelled as two separate elements of the multiset) both `> 1`, remove them and
insert `gcd(m, n)` and `lcm(m, n) / gcd(m, n)`.  Using `m ::ₘ n ::ₘ s` for the
source board automatically encodes that the two chosen positions are distinct
(they are two separate multiset elements, whose *values* may coincide). -/

/-- The exponent `g_p` for a prime `p` and board `B`: the `gcd` of the `p`-adic
valuations of the entries of `B`.  Since `gcd(a, 0) = a`, valuations equal to `0`
